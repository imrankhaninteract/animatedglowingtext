How To Create a Glowing Animated Text Effect with CSS


In this tutorial, you'll embark on an exciting journey of crafting a visually stunning HTML and CSS project. 
Starting from scratch, you'll build an engaging webpage that showcases an animated, 
glowing text effect using HTML and CSS.


Begin by setting up a new HTML document. Declare the document type at the beginning using the appropriate declaration.
Create the HTML structure. Start with the opening 'html' tag followed by 'head' and 'body' sections.
Within the 'head' section, import an external font using the '@import' rule from Google Fonts.
Inside the 'style' tags, define the CSS rules for various elements.
Set an animation for the 'h1' elements using the 'glow' animation, defining text shadows in different colors and durations.
Ensure proper box-sizing for all elements by using 'box-sizing: border-box' property.
Set the background style for the body, including a background color, image, and ensuring it covers the entire viewport.
Define the animation for the 'figure' element, using the 'wobble' animation with rotation values in different steps.
Style the 'h1' elements with specific properties: font size, weight, text transformation, positioning, padding, line height, and color.
Use 'transform' and 'translateZ' properties on multiple 'h1' elements to create a 3D effect with different translations.
Within the 'body' section, create a 'figure' element to contain multiple 'h1' headings displaying the text "Be The Light".
